# Script42sansData

Python/Pandas script for data import, calculations and export. All text-format-based.
This was made for the evaluation of some experimental data of a friend's bachelor thesis.
The name stems from the fact that the integral over the experimental data this app calculates approximates 42 (don't ask me for units. I'm not the physicist).
So the shoutout to Mr. Adams seemed obligatory.
